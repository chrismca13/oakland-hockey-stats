### Adult League Hockey Stats


My beer league hockey team had the same problem a lot of other teams across the country have. The rink only displays player statistics one season at a time, but a lot of us want to know how our stats look for our entire careers. 

We also want to know how our team stacks up against the team weâ€™re playing against. We want to know things like how our goal differentials compare, who has the better goalie, and who their leading scorers are. 
To solve these problems, we created a python script that scrapes career statistics for all players going back to 2007 and plugs the dataset into Tableau. The dashboard is saved in Power BI workspace here:
